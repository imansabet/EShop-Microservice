# EShop Microservice
Welcome to the EShop Microservice project! This repository demonstrates the implementation of a microservices-based architecture using .NET technologies. It is designed to serve as a learning resource and a practical example for developers exploring microservices.

About the Project :

This project showcases a fully functional e-commerce application built with a microservices architecture. It demonstrates best practices in software design, scalability, and maintainability. Each service is designed to be independent, highly available, and capable of scaling independently.

This project is inspired by and complements the Udemy course:

Microservices Architecture and Implementation on .NET

Technologies Used:

Entity Framework Core
Docker
RabbitMQ (for message communication between services)
Redis (for caching)
PostgreSQL (database)
Swagger (API documentation)
gRPC (for inter-service communication)
